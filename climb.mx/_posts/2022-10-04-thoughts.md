# Thoughts on Surviving

Some thoughts reflecting on 10 years after a near death experience. I wrote this in stream of thought at 5am exactly 2 hours before my accident happened.

- Death is closer than it appears, life is a short trip and you better make the best of it.
- It's not so bad. I've almost completely stopped climbing but I miss it dearly. The psychological impact has been very strong, even knowing that it would be. Personal life has been good.
- No amount money or material thing is worth losing peace over.
- You are alone in the world, but network and friendships matter.
- Do what you want.

What do I want?

- Time
- Peace
- Love
- Purpose
- Art
- Friendship
- Knowledge
- Food and nurturing
- Health

Today, celebrating 10 years after the experience:

Eat good food in good company
- Read
- Write
- Woodwork
- Walk
