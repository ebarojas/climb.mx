# Reusing old gear

In the past months years I’ve grown into the hobby of woodworking and have come to appreciate hand-made things a bit more, which has led me away some of the more industrialised outdoor products out there.

One of those things is a pair of old Thom McCan boots that were involuntarily inherited from my father in law. I don’t think he ever used them, from the looks of the soles, and from what I gather they were bought in the 80s or 90s in Sears or similar. They are exquisitely hand-made in Italy. Not light, and definitely not as easy to walk with as newer trekking boots that are closer to sneakers, however I gave them a go on a controlled environment and was pleased to see that were holding up quite well and were comfortable to boot.

Next time you find an old pair of hand-made shoes that someone wants to throw out, think if you can make them work.
