El Dinero, Fenómeno Económico Jurídico, José Luis Curiel Benfield 1943

In Praise of Shadows, Jun ichiro Tanizaki

This is one of my favourite books, ever. It's a study of very simple japanese things, among them, light. One of my minimalist high level reads, is that the author criticises the western ways of "too much light" and emphasises in great prose, how much more beautiful things look in the shadows. At first glance, you could think that this book is pointless, but it's actually so applicable in every thing in life. There is much to be said about keeping things simple, about appreciating little details in your abode and about the japanese way of doing things, but to me being able to appreciate shadows is about character and your state of mind. What I mean is that you won't always be super happy, you'll have points when life is tough and appears that not much light is coming in, this is when you need to praise shadows.

Don Quixote de la Mancha, Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra

Ignacio Torres Adalid y la Industria del Pulque, Mario Ramírez Rancaño

I bought this book second hand in a book fair in Morelia Michoacán. It was 50 Pesos and it was interesting to me because I am learning Nawawtl right now and [Pulque (Oktli in nawatl)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulque) is very present in the language and mexica mythology. To my surprise, it was my business side that most appreciated this work. For those that don't know Pulque is a prehispanic drink, it is roughly 2,000 years old and is made from the fermented sap of some species of Agave called Agave Salmiana, Agave Atrovirens and Agave Mapisaga, it tastes a bit like Kombutcha and a lot like the korean drink [makgeolli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makgeolli). Pulque was forbidden by the spaniards before the mexican independence, it became our national proud drink after our independence but it couldn't really reach far from where it was brewed because it was (and still is) perishable and there was no transport infrastructure. As with many things, this changed drastically with the construction of the railroads in Mexico. Suddenly Pulque could be hauled by the tonnes to Mexico City and any other place. This lead to a Pulque boom, the haciendas that cultivated agave pulquero appreciated in value to the tune of 30x and an aristocracia pulquera was born under the government of Porfirio Díaz, Ignacio Torres Adalid was perhaps the most characteristic pulque aristocrat, hence the title of the book. But come the revolution and [José Vasconcelos'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Vasconcelos) rise to power as the intelectual leader of the new mexico and his disdain for indigenous culture led to the 100+ year decline in Pulque consumption that we see today. Don't get me wrong, Vasconcelos had many qualities, but he really did NOT like Pulque and genuinely thought that it was bad for your health. Vasconcelos and his ilk began a dirty war over Pulque that was so effective we are still waging it today. If you've heard Pulque is fermented with feces or similar well, now you know why, and just for the record, Pulque does not require the addition of anything, feces or otherwise, to ferment, just like sourdough, kimchee or kombutcha. This dirty war on Pulque and the aristocracia pulquera might be coming to an end soon as Pulque rises in popularity with younger generations, yet today beer is king and this is no coincidence, beer was the ultimate benefficiary of this war, with active measures taken to disband the pulque aristocracy and even funding that was labeled for Pulque being used for beer, according to the book some of this funding led to research that made beer stable enough to be bottled and sold several months after production. Maybe we can dethrone the literal "Corona" and our ancient drink might rise again.
