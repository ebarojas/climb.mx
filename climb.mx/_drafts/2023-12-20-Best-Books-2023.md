El Dinero, Fenómeno Económico Jurídico, José Luis Curiel Benfield 1943

In Praise of Shadows, Jun ichiro Tanizaki

This is one of my favourite books, ever. It's a study of very simple japanese things, among them, light. One of my minimalist high level reads, is that the author criticises the western ways of "too much light" and emphasises in great prose, how much more beautiful things look in the shadows. At first glance, you could think that this book is pointless, but it's actually so applicable in every thing in life. There is much to be said about keeping things simple, about appreciating little details in your abode and about the japanese way of doing things, but to me being able to appreciate shadows is about character and your state of mind. What I mean is that you won't always be super happy, you'll have points when life is tough and appears that not much light is coming in, this is when you need to praise shadows.

Don Quixote de la Mancha, Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra

Ignacio Torres Adalid y la Industria del Pulque, Mario Ramírez Rancaño

I bought this book second hand, in a book fair in Morelia Michoacán. It was 50 Pesos and it was interesting to me because I am learning Nawawtl right now and Pulque (Oktli in nawatl) is very present in the language and mexica mythology. To my surprise, it was business side that most appreciated this work. Pulque was forbidden by the spaniards before the mexican independence, it became our national proud  drink after our independence but it could'nt really reach far from where it was harveted from magueys because it was (and still is) perishable and there was no transport infrastructure. As with many things, this changed drastically with the construction of the railroads in Mexico. Suddenly Pulque could be hauled by the tonnes to Mexico City and any other place. There was a Pulque boom, the haciendas that cultivated agave pulquero appreciated in value to the tune of 30x and an aristocracia pulquera was born under the government of Porfirio Díaz.
