## El Dinero, Fenómeno Económico Jurídico, José Luis Curiel Benfield 1943

## In Praise of Shadows, Jun ichiro Tanizaki

This is one of my favourite books, ever. It's a study of very simple japanese things, among them, light. One of my minimalist high level reads, is that the author criticises the western ways of "too much light" and emphasises in great prose, how much more beautiful things look in the shadows. At first glance, you could think that this book is pointless, but it's actually so applicable in every thing in life. There is much to be said about keeping things simple, about appreciating little details in your abode and about the japanese way of doing things, but to me being able to appreciate shadows is about character and your state of mind. What I mean is that you won't always be super happy, you'll have points when life is tough and appears that not much light is coming in, this is when you need to praise shadows.

## Don Quixote de la Mancha, Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra

This book was written more or less at the same time of the conquest of Mexico. It is remarkable feat that we cancomfortably read a book that was written 500 years ago. When I say comfortably, I'm actually lying because this book is so old that you kind of need to translate it to understand it. I found a really good edition of this book with as much footnotes as original text and that was instrumental in my liking of it. This book details how a perfectly sane gentleman is kind of betrayed by books about knights and when he goes out and tries to experience the world in the way that it was described to him in these books, it just doesn't work and many funny things happen. I really think there is a parallel to be made with entrepreneourship books and I really feel that fighting windmills is very similar to trying to find product-market fit. 

## Ignacio Torres Adalid y la Industria del Pulque, Mario Ramírez Rancaño

I bought this book second hand in a book fair in Morelia Michoacán. It was 50 Pesos and it was interesting to me because I am learning Nawawtl right now and [Pulque (Oktli in nawatl)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulque) is very present in the language and mexica mythology. To my surprise, it was my business side that most appreciated this work. For those that don't know Pulque is a prehispanic drink, it is roughly 2,000 years old and is made from the fermented sap of some species of Agave called Agave Salmiana, Agave Atrovirens and Agave Mapisaga, it tastes a bit like Kombutcha and a lot like the korean drink [makgeolli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makgeolli). Pulque was forbidden by the spaniards before the mexican independence, it became our national proud drink after our independence but it couldn't really reach far from where it was brewed because it was (and still is) perishable and there was no transport infrastructure. As with many things, this changed drastically with the construction of the railroads in Mexico. Suddenly Pulque could be hauled by the tonnes to Mexico City and any other place. This lead to a Pulque boom, the haciendas that cultivated agave pulquero appreciated in value to the tune of 30x and an aristocracia pulquera was born under the government of Porfirio Díaz, Ignacio Torres Adalid was perhaps the most characteristic pulque aristocrat, hence the title of the book. But come the revolution and [José Vasconcelos'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Vasconcelos) rise to power as the intelectual leader of the new mexico and his disdain for indigenous culture led to the 100+ year decline in Pulque consumption that we see today. Don't get me wrong, Vasconcelos had many qualities, but he really did NOT like Pulque and genuinely thought that it was bad for your health. Vasconcelos and his ilk began a dirty war over Pulque that was so effective we are still waging it today. If you've heard Pulque is fermented with feces or similar well, now you know why, and just for the record, Pulque does not require the addition of anything, feces or otherwise, to ferment, just like sourdough, kimchee or kombutcha. This dirty war on Pulque and the aristocracia pulquera might be coming to an end soon as Pulque rises in popularity with younger generations, yet today beer is king and this is no coincidence, beer was the ultimate benefficiary of this war, with active measures taken to disband the pulque aristocracy and even funding that was labeled for Pulque being used for beer, according to the book some of this funding led to research that made beer stable enough to be bottled and sold several months after production. Maybe we can dethrone the literal "Corona" and our ancient drink might rise again.

## Prolegómenos biofílicos, Jorge Barojas with illustrations by Daniel Barojas

This book was written by my uncle, (Dr. Jorge Barojas)[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorge-Weber] and beautifully illustrated by my cousin Daniel Barojas. My uncle is the only other PhD in the family, he has been an inspiration and has provided a helping hand whenever I've needed it. My (cousin Daniel)[https://www.instagram.com/r5imaging/] started out as a graffiti artist and has transformed himself into a muralist: I love his work. He inspired me to study photography when I was younger and I've always been grateful to him for directing my attention to hip-hop and the Wu-Tang Clan from a very young age. This book is written as a love letter to life. I loved every paragraph of it and although it gets personal at times, its prose is beautiful.

## Building Patzcuaro, Building Mexico

## Born of this Land, my life story, 

## On War, Carl Von Clausewitz

## Growth Mindset, Carol S. Dweck

## 1Q84, Haruki Murakami

I read this book in its entirety about 13 years ago. It inspired me to read a lot of Murakami after that and I became sort of a fanboy, the interest dwindled after a couple of books but my interest in Japan has not. I picked this up again recently as I started to play around with Midjourney's AI image generation, I always wanted to picture Aomame's entry scene where she climbs down the stairs of that bridge in Tokyo and as I asked Midjourney to create some example images I got the urge to re-read some of it. I really enjoyed listening to Janacek's Sinfonietta and visualising Aomame's character while I read it. It seems books as long as these have little place in today's 280 character world and re-reading it has made me realise how sad that is.

## Notes from the Underground, Fyodor Dostoevsky

So, I've been a really big fan of the stoics since I was a young kid. I have Marcus Aurelius' meditations in my kindle and casually read it whenever I'm stressed. I would say reading this book gave me a broader appreciation of the randomness in life. In this book, Dostoevsky's character states that: 

> I agree that two times two makes four is an excellent thing; but if we are dispensing praise, then two times two makes five is sometimes a most charming little thing as well.

Imagine that, 2+2=5 - Isn't that so... enriching? In this world where one can know the answer to almost anything instantly, find supporting evidence for any wicked theory and account for every human need at all times. Just as Dostoevsky states sometimes 2+2=4 is "no longer life".
